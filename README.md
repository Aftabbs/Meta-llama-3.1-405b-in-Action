Meta Llama 3.1: Latest Open-Source AI Model Takes on GPT-4o mini Based on their recent announcement, their flagship open-source model has a massive 405 Billion parameters. This model has been said to have beaten other LLMs in almost every benchmark out there. The model is said to have superior capabilities.
Meta also mentions that they used a standard decoder-only transformer model architecture (basically an auto-regressive transformer) with minor adaptations rather than a mixture-of-experts model to maximize training stability.
